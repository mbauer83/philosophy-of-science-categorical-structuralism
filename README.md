# Research Materials - Categorical Structuralism for Philosophy of Science

## Purpose

This repository contains research materials and drafts for publications exploring how **category- and topos-theoretical resources** can illuminate the structure and relations of **empirical theories**, in a manner inspired by Sneed, Suppe, and Munich Structuralism.  

The primary goal is **meta-theoretical**: to investigate how far categorical analogies, constructions, and tools can formalize theory-theory and theory-world relations, and to understand which structural insights about empirical theories can be revealed through these methods. Toy examples and simplified models are included as illustrative cases to **test and exemplify** the formal framework, but the project is not focused on producing models of particular empirical phenomena.

The program leverages methods from:  
- **Munich structuralism** (Sneed, Suppe, Balzer, Moulines et al.),
- **Topos theory and classifying toposes** (Goldblatt, Caramello et al.),  
- **Institution theory and fibrations** (Goguen & Burstall),  
- **Category-theoretic analysis of equivalence and translation of theories** (Halvorson, Barrett, Weatherall et al.),  
and aims to integrate these perspectives into a sketch of **meta-theoretical framework**.

## Outlining Ideas

* **Theory** (Sneed: set-theoretic predicate / family of models)  
↦ Category / Theory-object / Classifying topos / Institution.  

* **Potential models / actual models**  
↦ Models = functors / geometric morphisms into a semantic topos; actual models satisfy axioms, potential models satisfy only signature constraints.

* **Intended models / applications**  
↦ Selected via semantic target (Set, sheaf topos) or via additional structure (functors into a category of empirical systems).

* **Objects as “black boxes” and Yoneda**  
↦ Yoneda lemma: an object is determined by all its relationships; presheaves formalize “probing by relations/experiments.”

* **Abstraction / forgetting**  
↦ Forgetful functors, adjoints, monads encode abstraction, quotienting, and reconstruction. Fibrations/indexed categories formalize context-dependent perspectives.

* **Inter-theory relations**  
↦ Functorial translations, natural transformations, Morita-equivalence, equivalence of classifying toposes, institution morphisms. These provide formal representations of reduction, translation, and change of perspective.

## Conceptual Toolkit

* **Yoneda embedding / presheaf categories** — formalize relational probing and the dependence of objects on observable interactions.  

* **Functors as models** — model theories as functors from a syntactic category to a semantic category (Set or another topos).  

* **Classifying topos** — represents the “universal model”; enables reasoning about all models of a theory across semantic contexts.  

* **Institutions / indexed categories / fibrations** — formalize families of theories, varying signatures, and context-dependent semantics; capture how observational or structural constraints shape possible mappings between theories.  

* **Forgetful functors, adjoints, monads** — encode abstraction, addition/forgetting of structure, and reconstruction constraints.  

* **Natural transformations / 2-categorical structure** — formalize translations, refinements, and interpretations between theories; capture higher-level inter-theory relations.  

* **Sheaves / local toposes** — model context-dependence, partial observability, and “local” access to theoretical structures; allow encoding of constraints from observational limitations.  

* **Morita / presentation equivalence** — formalizes when different syntactic presentations correspond to the same semantic content (classifying topos equivalence); supports reasoning about theory identity, reduction, and invariance under reformulation.

## Potential Advantages

* Yoneda embedding formalizes the idea that "objects are determined by all probes."  

* Codomain choice for models (Set, sheaves, etc.) encodes epistemic and observational limitations.  

* Fibrations / indexed categories capture that the way you can probe a system depends on the structure of the probe itself.  

* Institutions, natural transformations, and classifying topos constructions provide **formal mechanisms for inter-theory translation, equivalence, reduction, and theory change**, while respecting context-dependent observational and structural constraints.
